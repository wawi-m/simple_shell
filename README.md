# Simple Shell

It’s time for the famous Simple Shell project. 
This is one of the most anticipated project and also one that will challenge you a lot about everything you have learn so far:

  * Basics of programming
  * Basics of C
  * Basics of thinking like an engineer
  * Group work
  * Learning how to learn
